Most Scotch bonnets have a heat rating of 100,000–350,000 Scoville units. For comparison, most jalapeño peppers have a heat rating of 2,500 to 8,000 on the Scoville scale.

The Scotch bonnet has a sweeter flavour and stouter shape, distinct from its habanero relative with which it is often confused, and gives jerk dishes (pork/chicken) and other Caribbean dishes their unique flavour. Scotch bonnets are mostly used in West African, Antiguan, Kittitian/Nevisian, Anguilan, Dominican, St. Lucian, St Vincentian, Grenadian, Trinidadian, Jamaican, Barbadian, Guyanese, Surinamese, Haitian and Cayman cuisines and pepper sauces, though they often show up in other Caribbean recipes.

They also may be ground into a flour form used for making water chestnut cake, which is common as part of dim sum cuisine. They are unusual among vegetables for remaining crisp even after being cooked or canned, because their cell walls are cross-linked and strengthened by certain phenolic compounds, such as oligomers of ferulic acid. This property is shared by other vegetables that remain crisp in this manner, including the tiger nut and lotus root. The corms contain the antibiotic agent puchiin, which is stable to high temperature. Apart from the edible corms, the leaves can be used for cattlefeed, mulch or compost.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe corms are rich in carbohydrates (about 90% by dry weight), especially starch (about 60% by dry weight), and are also a good source of dietary fiber, riboflavin, vitamin B6, potassium, copper, and manganese.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf eaten uncooked, the surface of the plants may transmit fasciolopsiasis.","img":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/so-yummy/ingredients/640c2dd963a319ea671e3846.png"},{"_id":"640c2dd963a319ea671e37be","name":"Lamb Shoulder","desc":"Meat from the shoulder of a young sheep, commonly used for slow cooking and stews.","img":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/so-yummy/ingredients/640c2dd963a319ea671e37be.png"},{"_id":"640c2dd963a319ea671e36cc","name":"English Mustard","desc":"A spicy, yellowish-brown mustard commonly used in British cuisine for sandwiches, dressings, and sauces.","img":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/so-yummy/ingredients/640c2dd963a319ea671e36cc.png"},{"_id":"640c2dd963a319ea671e3709","name":"King Prawns","desc":"A large, meaty type of shrimp that is often used in seafood dishes.

(1–1.8 kg) and is skinned and cut into short lengths for sale.\\r\\n\\r\\nOxtail is a bony, gelatin-rich meat, which is usually slow-cooked as a stew[1] or braised. It is a traditional stock base for a soup. Traditional preparations involve slow cooking, so some modern recipes take a shortcut using a pressure cooker. Oxtail is the main ingredient of the Italian dish coda alla vaccinara (a classic of Roman cuisine). It is a popular flavour for powder, instant and premade canned soups in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Oxtails are also one of the popular bases for Russian aspic appetizer dishes (холодец or студень), along with pig trotters or ears or cow \\"knees\\", but are the preferred ingredients among Russian Jews because they can be Kosher.\\r\\n\\r\\nVersions of oxtail soup are popular traditional dishes in South America, West Africa, China, Spain [2] and Indonesia. In Chinese cuisine, it\'s usually made into a soup called 牛尾汤 (niúwěi tāng, \\"oxtail soup\\"). In Korean cuisine, a soup made with oxtail is called kkori gomtang (see gomguk). It is a thick soup seasoned with salt and eaten with a bowl of rice. It can be used as a stock for making tteokguk (rice cake soup). Stewed oxtail with butter bean or as main dish (with rice) is popular in Jamaica, Trinidad, and other West Indian cultures. Oxtail is also very popular in South Africa where it is often cooked in a traditional skillet called a potjie, which is a three-legged cast iron pot placed over an open fire. Oxtail is also eaten in other southern parts of Africa like Zimbabwe and served with sadza and greens. In the United States, oxtail is a mainstay in African American and West Indian households. In Cuban cuisine, a stew can be made from oxtail called rabo encendido. In the Philippines, it is prepared in a peanut based stew called Kare-kare. In Iran, Oxtail is slow-cooked and served as a substitute for shank in a main dish called Baghla-Poli-Mahicheh which is prepared with rice, shank (or oxtail) and a mixture of herbs including dill, coriander, parsley and garlic.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, oxtail has the meat-cutting classification NAMP 1791.","img":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/so-yummy/ingredients/640c2dd963a319ea671e3841.png"},{"_id":"640c2dd963a319ea671e37f7","name":"Mirin","desc":"A type of sweet rice wine that is commonly used in Japanese cuisine for its mild sweetness and ability to balance flavors in dishes like teriyaki sauce.","img":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/so-yummy/ingredients/640c2dd963a319ea671e37f7.png"},{"_id":"640c2dd963a319ea671e3800","name":"Lard","desc":"Rendered pork fat that is often used in cooking and baking for added flavor and texture.","img":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/so-yummy/ingredients/640c2dd963a319ea671e3800.png"},{"_id":"640c2dd963a319ea671e368b","name":"Celery Salt","desc":"A seasoning made from ground celery seeds and salt, often used as a flavoring for snacks, seasonings, and condiments, such as Bloody Mary cocktails, pickles, and potato chips.","img":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/so-yummy/ingredients/640c2dd963a319ea671e368b.png"},{"_id":"640c2dd963a319ea671e36d4","name":"Fish Sauce","desc":"A pungent, salty sauce made from fermented fish commonly used in Southeast Asian cuisine as a seasoning and condiment.","img":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/so-yummy/ingredients/640c2dd963a319ea671e36d4.png"},{"_id":"640c2dd963a319ea671e36dc","name":"French Lentils","desc":"Small, greenish-brown lentils that have a slightly nutty flavor and a firm texture.

Many species of salmon have been introduced into non-native environments such as the Great Lakes of North America and Patagonia in South America. Salmon are intensively farmed in many parts of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nTypically, salmon are anadromous: they hatch in fresh water, migrate to the ocean, then return to fresh water to reproduce. However, populations of several species are restricted to fresh water through their lives. Folklore has it that the fish return to the exact spot where they hatched to spawn. Tracking studies have shown this to be mostly true. A portion of a returning salmon run may stray and spawn in different freshwater systems; the percent of straying depends on the species of salmon. Homing behavior has been shown to depend on olfactory memory. Salmon date back to the Neogene.","img":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/so-yummy/ingredients/640c2dd963a319ea671e365c.png"},{"_id":"640c2dd963a319ea671e383f","name":"Paella Rice","desc":"Paella[a] is a Valencian rice dish that has ancient roots but its modern form originated in the mid-19th century in the area around Albufera lagoon on the east coast of Spain, adjacent to the city of Valencia.

Valencian paella is believed to be the original recipe and consists of white rice, green beans (bajoqueta and tavella), meat (chicken, duck and rabbit), white beans (garrofón), snails, and seasoning such as saffron and rosemary. Another very common but seasonal ingredient is artichokes. Seafood paella replaces meat with seafood and omits beans and green vegetables. Mixed paella is a free-style combination of meat from land animals, seafood, vegetables, and sometimes beans.

The genus Zanthoxylum belongs in the rue or citrus family, and, despite its name, is not closely related to either black pepper nor the chili pepper.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe husk or hull (pericarp) around the seeds may be used whole, especially in Sichuan cuisine, and the finely ground powder is one of the ingredients for five-spice powder. It is also used in traditional Chinese medicine. The pericarp is most often used, but the leaves of various species are also used in some regions of China.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother species of Zanthoxylum native to China, Z. schinifolium, called xiāng jiāo zi (香椒子, \\"aromatic peppercorn\\") or qīng huā jiāo (青花椒, \\"green flower pepper\\"), is used as a spice in Hebei.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the exact flavour and composition of different species from the genus Zanthoxylum vary, most share the same essential characteristics. So while the terms \\"Sichuan pepper\\" and sanshō may refer specifically to Z. simulans and Z. piperitum, respectively, the two are commonly used interchangeably.\\r\\n\\r\\nRelated species are used in the cuisines of Tibet, Bhutan, Nepal, Thailand, and India (the Konkani and Uttarakhandi people) and Toba Batak peoples. In Bhutan, this pepper is known as thingye and is used liberally in preparation of soups, gruels, and phaag sha paa (pork slices).[citation needed] In Nepal, timur is used in the popular foods momo, thukpa, chow mein, chicken chilli, and other meat dishes. It is also widely used in homemade pickles. People take timur as a medicine for stomach or digestion problems, in a preparation with cloves of garlic and mountain salt with warm water.","img":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/so-yummy/ingredients/640c2dd963a319ea671e384b.png"},{"_id":"640c2dd963a319ea671e3725","name":"Muscovado Sugar","desc":"A type of unrefined brown sugar that has a strong, molasses-like flavor and a moist texture, and is often used in baking and cooking for its rich taste and color.","img":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/so-yummy/ingredients/640c2dd963a319ea671e3725.png"},{"_id":"640c2dd963a319ea671e3835","name":"Sun-Dried Tomatoes","desc":"Tomatoes that have been sliced and then left to dry in the sun or a dehydrator until most of their moisture has evaporated, resulting in a concentrated and intensely flavored product.","img":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/so-yummy/ingredients/640c2dd963a319ea671e3835.png"},{"_id":"640c2dd963a319ea671e374e","name":"Red Onions","desc":"A type of onion that has a deep purple skin and a mild, sweet flavor.

The name in Arabic means \\"head of the shop\\" and implies a mixture of the best spices the seller has to offer. Ras el hanout is used in many savory dishes, sometimes rubbed on meat or fish, or stirred into couscous or rice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no definitive composition of spices that makes up ras el hanout. Each shop, company, or family may have their own blend. The mixture usually consists of over a dozen spices, in different proportions. Commonly used ingredients include cardamom, cumin, clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, mace, allspice, dry ginger, chili peppers, coriander seed, peppercorn, sweet and hot paprika, fenugreek, and dry turmeric. Some spices may be particular to the region, such as ash berries, chufa, grains of paradise, orris root, monk\'s pepper, cubebs, dried rosebud, fennel seed or aniseed, galangal, long pepper. Ingredients may be toasted before being ground or pounded in a mortar and mixed together. Some preparations include salt or sugar, but that is generally not the accepted practice. Garlic, saffron, nuts or dry herbs are generally not included, as they are usually added to dishes individually, but some commercial preparations, particularly in Europe and North America, may contain them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe composition of ras el hanout differs somewhat from the Baharat spice mix, but they differ more by the types of dishes they are associated with and by region rather than the ingredients in them. Although used by Berber people, it should not be confused with \\"berbere\\" spice mix from Ethiopia.\\r\\n\\r\\nCertain supposed aphrodisiacs, including the notoriously dangerous \\"green metallic beetles\\", cantharides, have appeared in many Moroccan prescriptions, but these seem to be irrelevant for flavouring purposes.","img":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/so-yummy/ingredients/640c2dd963a319ea671e3866.png"},{"_id":"640c2dd963a319ea671e369f","name":"Chopped Onion","desc":"Pieces of onion that have been diced or chopped, commonly used as a flavor base for soups, stews, and other dishes.","img":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/so-yummy/ingredients/640c2dd963a319ea671e369f.png"},{"_id":"640c2dd963a319ea671e3760","name":"Sausages","desc":"Sausages are a type of seasoned meat that are typically encased in a casing made of animal intestine or synthetic materials.

Small delicate leaves are better than the large bristly ones but, if only large leaves are to hand, then trim them to roughly 12 by 12 cms so that you don\'t get too many layers of leaves around the filling. And remove any stalks. Drain the preserved leaves, immerse them in boiling water for 10 minutes and then leave to dry on a tea towel before use. \\r\\nBasmati rice with butter and pine nuts is an ideal accompaniment. Couscous is great, too. Serves four.\\r\\nFirst make the filling. Put all the ingredients, apart from the tomatoes, in a bowl. Cut the tomatoes in half, coarsely grate into the bowl and discard the skins. Add half a teaspoon of salt and some black pepper, and stir. Leave on the side, or in the fridge, for up to a day. Before using, gently squeeze with your hands and drain away any juices that come out.\\r\\nTo make the sauce, heat the oil in a medium pan. Add the ginger and garlic, cook for a minute or two, taking care not to burn them, then add the tomato, lemon juice and sugar. Season, and simmer for 20 minutes.\\r\\nWhile the sauce is bubbling away, prepare the vine leaves. Use any torn or broken leaves to line the base of a wide, heavy saucepan. Trim any leaves from the fennel, cut it vertically into 0.5cm-thick slices and spread over the base of the pan to cover completely.\\r\\nLay a prepared vine leaf (see intro) on a work surface, veiny side up. Put two teaspoons of filling at the base of the leaf in a 2cm-long by 1cm-wide strip. Fold the sides of the leaf over the filling, then roll it tightly from bottom to top, in a cigar shape. Place in the pan, seam down, and repeat with the remaining leaves, placing them tightly next to each other in lines or circles (in two layers if necessary).\\r\\nPour the sauce over the leaves (and, if needed, add water just to cover). Place a plate on top, to weigh the leaves down, then cover with a lid. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and cook on a bare simmer for 70 minutes. Most of the liquid should evaporate. Remove from the heat, and leave to cool a little - they are best served warm. When serving, bring to the table in the pan - it looks great. Serve a few vine leaves and fennel slices with warm rice. Spoon the braising juices on top and garnish with coriander.","description":"A Moroccan-inspired dish made with lamb, tomatoes, onions, and spices (such as cinnamon, ginger, and cumin), typically served with couscous or bread.","thumb":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/so-yummy/preview/Lamb%20tomato%20and%20sweet%20spices.jpg","preview":"https://ftp.goit.study/img/so-yummy/preview/Lamb%20tomato%20and%20sweet%20spices.jpg","time":"90","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaZb1MnFBgA","tags":[""],"ingredients":[{"id":"640c2dd963a319ea671e372c","measure":"2 tbsp"},{"id":"640c2dd963a319ea671e36e8","measure":"4cm piece finely chopped"},{"id":"640c2dd963a319ea671e36e3","measure":"2 cloves peeled and chopped"},{"id":"640c2dd963a319ea671e377f","measure":"800g peeled and chopped "},{"id":"640c2dd963a319ea671e3712","measure":"2 tbsp"},{"id":"640c2dd963a319ea671e3687","measure":"1 tsp"},{"id":"640c2dd963a319ea671e378d","measure":"50"},{"id":"640c2dd963a319ea671e36d0","measure":"1 large"},{"id":"640c2dd963a319ea671e370d","measure":"400g"},{"id":"640c2dd963a319ea671e37ae","measure":"1 medium"},{"id":"640c2dd963a319ea671e3669","measure":"2 tbsp"},{"id":"640c2dd963a319ea671e36a0","measure":"2 tbsp"},{"id":"640c2dd963a319ea671e36af","measure":"2 tbsp chopped"},{"id":"640c2dd963a319ea671e36a5","measure":"½ tsp ground "}],"rating":3.84},{"_id":"6462a8f74c3d0ddd28897fdf","title":"Lamb Rogan josh","category":"Lamb","area":"Indian","instructions":"\\r\\nPut the onions in a food processor and whizz until very finely chopped.
