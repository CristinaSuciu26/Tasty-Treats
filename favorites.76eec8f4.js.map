Also called ata rodo by Yoruba speakers of Nigeria, it is found mainly in the Caribbean islands; it is also found in Guyana (where it is called the ball-of-fire pepper), the Maldives Islands (where it is called githeyo mirus), Panama (where it is called aji chombo) and West Africa. Most Scotch bonnets have a heat rating of 100,000–350,000 Scoville units. For comparison, most jalapeño peppers have a heat rating of 2,500 to 8,000 on the Scoville scale. However, completely sweet varieties of Scotch bonnet are grown on some of the Caribbean islands, called cachucha peppers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese peppers are used to flavour many different dishes and cuisines worldwide and are often used in hot sauces and condiments. The Scotch bonnet has a sweeter flavour and stouter shape, distinct from its habanero relative with which it is often confused, and gives jerk dishes (pork/chicken) and other Caribbean dishes their unique flavour. Scotch bonnets are mostly used in West African, Antiguan, Kittitian/Nevisian, Anguilan, Dominican, St. Lucian, St Vincentian, Grenadian, Trinidadian, Jamaican, Barbadian, Guyanese, Surinamese, Haitian and Cayman cuisines and pepper sauces, though they often show up in other Caribbean recipes. It is also used in Costa Rica and Panama for Caribbean-styled recipes such as rice and beans, Rondón, saus, beef patties, and Ceviche.\\r\\n\\r\\nFresh, ripe Scotch bonnets can change from green to yellow to scarlet red, however many other breeds of this pepper can ripen to orange, yellow, peach, or even a chocolate brown.\",\r\n      \"img\": \"https://ftp.goit.study/img/so-yummy/ingredients/640c2dd963a319ea671e3840.png\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"_id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e3803\",\r\n      \"name\": \"Haddock\",\r\n      \"desc\": \"A saltwater fish that is commonly found in the North Atlantic and is often used in cooking due to its mild, slightly sweet flavor and firm texture.\",\r\n      \"img\": \"https://ftp.goit.study/img/so-yummy/ingredients/640c2dd963a319ea671e3803.png\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"_id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e371a\",\r\n      \"name\": \"Madras Paste\",\r\n      \"desc\": \"Madras paste is a blend of spices commonly used in Indian cuisine, particularly in dishes from the Madras region.

Formerly, it referred only to the tail of an ox or steer, a bullock (a castrated male).[citation needed] An oxtail typically weighs 2 to 4 lbs. (1–1.8 kg) and is skinned and cut into short lengths for sale.\\r\\n\\r\\nOxtail is a bony, gelatin-rich meat, which is usually slow-cooked as a stew[1] or braised. It is a traditional stock base for a soup. Traditional preparations involve slow cooking, so some modern recipes take a shortcut using a pressure cooker. Oxtail is the main ingredient of the Italian dish coda alla vaccinara (a classic of Roman cuisine). It is a popular flavour for powder, instant and premade canned soups in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Oxtails are also one of the popular bases for Russian aspic appetizer dishes (холодец or студень), along with pig trotters or ears or cow \\\"knees\\\", but are the preferred ingredients among Russian Jews because they can be Kosher.\\r\\n\\r\\nVersions of oxtail soup are popular traditional dishes in South America, West Africa, China, Spain [2] and Indonesia. In Chinese cuisine, it's usually made into a soup called 牛尾汤 (niúwěi tāng, \\\"oxtail soup\\\"). In Korean cuisine, a soup made with oxtail is called kkori gomtang (see gomguk). It is a thick soup seasoned with salt and eaten with a bowl of rice. It can be used as a stock for making tteokguk (rice cake soup). Stewed oxtail with butter bean or as main dish (with rice) is popular in Jamaica, Trinidad, and other West Indian cultures. Oxtail is also very popular in South Africa where it is often cooked in a traditional skillet called a potjie, which is a three-legged cast iron pot placed over an open fire. Oxtail is also eaten in other southern parts of Africa like Zimbabwe and served with sadza and greens. In the United States, oxtail is a mainstay in African American and West Indian households. In Cuban cuisine, a stew can be made from oxtail called rabo encendido. In the Philippines, it is prepared in a peanut based stew called Kare-kare. In Iran, Oxtail is slow-cooked and served as a substitute for shank in a main dish called Baghla-Poli-Mahicheh which is prepared with rice, shank (or oxtail) and a mixture of herbs including dill, coriander, parsley and garlic.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, oxtail has the meat-cutting classification NAMP 1791.\",\r\n      \"img\": \"https://ftp.goit.study/img/so-yummy/ingredients/640c2dd963a319ea671e3841.png\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"_id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e37f7\",\r\n      \"name\": \"Mirin\",\r\n      \"desc\": \"A type of sweet rice wine that is commonly used in Japanese cuisine for its mild sweetness and ability to balance flavors in dishes like teriyaki sauce.\",\r\n      \"img\": \"https://ftp.goit.study/img/so-yummy/ingredients/640c2dd963a319ea671e37f7.png\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"_id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e3800\",\r\n      \"name\": \"Lard\",\r\n      \"desc\": \"Rendered pork fat that is often used in cooking and baking for added flavor and texture.\",\r\n      \"img\": \"https://ftp.goit.study/img/so-yummy/ingredients/640c2dd963a319ea671e3800.png\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"_id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e368b\",\r\n      \"name\": \"Celery Salt\",\r\n      \"desc\": \"A seasoning made from ground celery seeds and salt, often used as a flavoring for snacks, seasonings, and condiments, such as Bloody Mary cocktails, pickles, and potato chips.\",\r\n      \"img\": \"https://ftp.goit.study/img/so-yummy/ingredients/640c2dd963a319ea671e368b.png\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"_id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e36d4\",\r\n      \"name\": \"Fish Sauce\",\r\n      \"desc\": \"A pungent, salty sauce made from fermented fish commonly used in Southeast Asian cuisine as a seasoning and condiment.\",\r\n      \"img\": \"https://ftp.goit.study/img/so-yummy/ingredients/640c2dd963a319ea671e36d4.png\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"_id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e36dc\",\r\n      \"name\": \"French Lentils\",\r\n      \"desc\": \"Small, greenish-brown lentils that have a slightly nutty flavor and a firm texture.

Salmon are intensively farmed in many parts of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nTypically, salmon are anadromous: they hatch in fresh water, migrate to the ocean, then return to fresh water to reproduce. However, populations of several species are restricted to fresh water through their lives. Folklore has it that the fish return to the exact spot where they hatched to spawn. Tracking studies have shown this to be mostly true. A portion of a returning salmon run may stray and spawn in different freshwater systems; the percent of straying depends on the species of salmon.

Another very common but seasonal ingredient is artichokes. Seafood paella replaces meat with seafood and omits beans and green vegetables. Mixed paella is a free-style combination of meat from land animals, seafood, vegetables, and sometimes beans.

Ras el hanout is used in many savory dishes, sometimes rubbed on meat or fish, or stirred into couscous or rice.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no definitive composition of spices that makes up ras el hanout. Each shop, company, or family may have their own blend. The mixture usually consists of over a dozen spices, in different proportions. Commonly used ingredients include cardamom, cumin, clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, mace, allspice, dry ginger, chili peppers, coriander seed, peppercorn, sweet and hot paprika, fenugreek, and dry turmeric. Some spices may be particular to the region, such as ash berries, chufa, grains of paradise, orris root, monk's pepper, cubebs, dried rosebud, fennel seed or aniseed, galangal, long pepper. Ingredients may be toasted before being ground or pounded in a mortar and mixed together. Some preparations include salt or sugar, but that is generally not the accepted practice. Garlic, saffron, nuts or dry herbs are generally not included, as they are usually added to dishes individually, but some commercial preparations, particularly in Europe and North America, may contain them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe composition of ras el hanout differs somewhat from the Baharat spice mix, but they differ more by the types of dishes they are associated with and by region rather than the ingredients in them.

Small delicate leaves are better than the large bristly ones but, if only large leaves are to hand, then trim them to roughly 12 by 12 cms so that you don't get too many layers of leaves around the filling. And remove any stalks. Drain the preserved leaves, immerse them in boiling water for 10 minutes and then leave to dry on a tea towel before use. \\r\\nBasmati rice with butter and pine nuts is an ideal accompaniment. Couscous is great, too. Serves four.\\r\\nFirst make the filling. Put all the ingredients, apart from the tomatoes, in a bowl. Cut the tomatoes in half, coarsely grate into the bowl and discard the skins. Add half a teaspoon of salt and some black pepper, and stir. Leave on the side, or in the fridge, for up to a day. Before using, gently squeeze with your hands and drain away any juices that come out.\\r\\nTo make the sauce, heat the oil in a medium pan. Add the ginger and garlic, cook for a minute or two, taking care not to burn them, then add the tomato, lemon juice and sugar. Season, and simmer for 20 minutes.\\r\\nWhile the sauce is bubbling away, prepare the vine leaves. Use any torn or broken leaves to line the base of a wide, heavy saucepan. Trim any leaves from the fennel, cut it vertically into 0.5cm-thick slices and spread over the base of the pan to cover completely.\\r\\nLay a prepared vine leaf (see intro) on a work surface, veiny side up. Put two teaspoons of filling at the base of the leaf in a 2cm-long by 1cm-wide strip. Fold the sides of the leaf over the filling, then roll it tightly from bottom to top, in a cigar shape. Place in the pan, seam down, and repeat with the remaining leaves, placing them tightly next to each other in lines or circles (in two layers if necessary).\\r\\nPour the sauce over the leaves (and, if needed, add water just to cover). Place a plate on top, to weigh the leaves down, then cover with a lid. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and cook on a bare simmer for 70 minutes. Most of the liquid should evaporate. Remove from the heat, and leave to cool a little - they are best served warm. When serving, bring to the table in the pan - it looks great. Serve a few vine leaves and fennel slices with warm rice. Spoon the braising juices on top and garnish with coriander.\",\r\n      \"description\": \"A Moroccan-inspired dish made with lamb, tomatoes, onions, and spices (such as cinnamon, ginger, and cumin), typically served with couscous or bread.\",\r\n      \"thumb\": \"https://ftp.goit.study/img/so-yummy/preview/Lamb%20tomato%20and%20sweet%20spices.jpg\",\r\n      \"preview\": \"https://ftp.goit.study/img/so-yummy/preview/Lamb%20tomato%20and%20sweet%20spices.jpg\",\r\n      \"time\": \"90\",\r\n      \"youtube\": \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaZb1MnFBgA\",\r\n      \"tags\": [\"\"],\r\n      \"ingredients\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e372c\",\r\n          \"measure\": \"2 tbsp\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e36e8\",\r\n          \"measure\": \"4cm piece finely chopped\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e36e3\",\r\n          \"measure\": \"2 cloves peeled and chopped\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e377f\",\r\n          \"measure\": \"800g peeled and chopped \"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e3712\",\r\n          \"measure\": \"2 tbsp\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e3687\",\r\n          \"measure\": \"1 tsp\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e378d\",\r\n          \"measure\": \"50\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e36d0\",\r\n          \"measure\": \"1 large\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e370d\",\r\n          \"measure\": \"400g\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e37ae\",\r\n          \"measure\": \"1 medium\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e3669\",\r\n          \"measure\": \"2 tbsp\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e36a0\",\r\n          \"measure\": \"2 tbsp\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e36af\",\r\n          \"measure\": \"2 tbsp chopped\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e36a5\",\r\n          \"measure\": \"½ tsp ground \"\r\n        }\r\n      ],\r\n      \"rating\": 3.84\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"_id\": \"6462a8f74c3d0ddd28897fdf\",\r\n      \"title\": \"Lamb Rogan josh\",\r\n      \"category\": \"Lamb\",\r\n      \"area\": \"Indian\",\r\n      \"instructions\": \"\\r\\nPut the onions in a food processor and whizz until very finely chopped.

To make the almond sponge, put the butter, sugar, flour, ground almonds, baking powder, eggs, vanilla and almond extract in a large bowl. Beat with an electric whisk until the mix comes together smoothly. Scrape into the tin, spreading to the corners, and bake for 25-30 mins – when you poke in a skewer, it should come out clean. Cool in the tin for 10 mins, then transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling while you make the second sponge.\\r\\nFor the pink sponge, line the tin as above. Mix all the ingredients together as above, but don’t add the almond extract. Fold in some pink food colouring. Then scrape it all into the tin and bake as before. Cool.\\r\\nTo assemble, heat the jam in a small pan until runny, then sieve. Barely trim two opposite edges from the almond sponge, then well trim a third edge. Roughly measure the height of the sponge, then cutting from the well-trimmed edge, use a ruler to help you cut 4 slices each the same width as the sponge height. Discard or nibble leftover sponge. Repeat with pink cake.\\r\\nTake 2 x almond slices and 2 x pink slices and trim so they are all the same length. Roll out one marzipan block on a surface lightly dusted with icing sugar to just over 20cm wide, then keep rolling lengthways until the marzipan is roughly 0.5cm thick. Brush with apricot jam, then lay a pink and an almond slice side by side at one end of the marzipan, brushing jam in between to stick sponges, and leaving 4cm clear marzipan at the end. Brush more jam on top of the sponges, then sandwich remaining 2 slices on top, alternating colours to give a checkerboard effect. Trim the marzipan to the length of the cakes.\\r\\nCarefully lift up the marzipan and smooth over the cake with your hands, but leave a small marzipan fold along the bottom edge before you stick it to the first side. Trim opposite side to match size of fold, then crimp edges using fingers and thumb (or, more simply, press with prongs of fork). If you like, mark the 10 slices using the prongs of a fork.\\r\\nAssemble second Battenberg and keep in an airtight box or well wrapped in cling film for up to 3 days.

Small delicate leaves are better than the large bristly ones but, if only large leaves are to hand, then trim them to roughly 12 by 12 cms so that you don't get too many layers of leaves around the filling. And remove any stalks. Drain the preserved leaves, immerse them in boiling water for 10 minutes and then leave to dry on a tea towel before use. \\r\\nBasmati rice with butter and pine nuts is an ideal accompaniment. Couscous is great, too. Serves four.\\r\\nFirst make the filling. Put all the ingredients, apart from the tomatoes, in a bowl. Cut the tomatoes in half, coarsely grate into the bowl and discard the skins. Add half a teaspoon of salt and some black pepper, and stir. Leave on the side, or in the fridge, for up to a day. Before using, gently squeeze with your hands and drain away any juices that come out.\\r\\nTo make the sauce, heat the oil in a medium pan. Add the ginger and garlic, cook for a minute or two, taking care not to burn them, then add the tomato, lemon juice and sugar. Season, and simmer for 20 minutes.\\r\\nWhile the sauce is bubbling away, prepare the vine leaves. Use any torn or broken leaves to line the base of a wide, heavy saucepan. Trim any leaves from the fennel, cut it vertically into 0.5cm-thick slices and spread over the base of the pan to cover completely.\\r\\nLay a prepared vine leaf (see intro) on a work surface, veiny side up. Put two teaspoons of filling at the base of the leaf in a 2cm-long by 1cm-wide strip. Fold the sides of the leaf over the filling, then roll it tightly from bottom to top, in a cigar shape. Place in the pan, seam down, and repeat with the remaining leaves, placing them tightly next to each other in lines or circles (in two layers if necessary).\\r\\nPour the sauce over the leaves (and, if needed, add water just to cover). Place a plate on top, to weigh the leaves down, then cover with a lid. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and cook on a bare simmer for 70 minutes. Most of the liquid should evaporate. Remove from the heat, and leave to cool a little - they are best served warm. When serving, bring to the table in the pan - it looks great. Serve a few vine leaves and fennel slices with warm rice. Spoon the braising juices on top and garnish with coriander.\",\r\n      \"description\": \"A Moroccan-inspired dish made with lamb, tomatoes, onions, and spices (such as cinnamon, ginger, and cumin), typically served with couscous or bread.\",\r\n      \"thumb\": \"https://ftp.goit.study/img/so-yummy/preview/Lamb%20tomato%20and%20sweet%20spices.jpg\",\r\n      \"preview\": \"https://ftp.goit.study/img/so-yummy/preview/Lamb%20tomato%20and%20sweet%20spices.jpg\",\r\n      \"time\": \"90\",\r\n      \"youtube\": \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaZb1MnFBgA\",\r\n      \"tags\": [\"\"],\r\n      \"ingredients\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e372c\",\r\n          \"measure\": \"2 tbsp\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e36e8\",\r\n          \"measure\": \"4cm piece finely chopped\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e36e3\",\r\n          \"measure\": \"2 cloves peeled and chopped\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e377f\",\r\n          \"measure\": \"800g peeled and chopped \"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e3712\",\r\n          \"measure\": \"2 tbsp\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e3687\",\r\n          \"measure\": \"1 tsp\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e378d\",\r\n          \"measure\": \"50\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e36d0\",\r\n          \"measure\": \"1 large\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e370d\",\r\n          \"measure\": \"400g\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e37ae\",\r\n          \"measure\": \"1 medium\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e3669\",\r\n          \"measure\": \"2 tbsp\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e36a0\",\r\n          \"measure\": \"2 tbsp\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e36af\",\r\n          \"measure\": \"2 tbsp chopped\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e36a5\",\r\n          \"measure\": \"½ tsp ground \"\r\n        }\r\n      ],\r\n      \"rating\": 3.84\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"_id\": \"6462a8f74c3d0ddd28897fdf\",\r\n      \"title\": \"Lamb Rogan josh\",\r\n      \"category\": \"Lamb\",\r\n      \"area\": \"Indian\",\r\n      \"instructions\": \"\\r\\nPut the onions in a food processor and whizz until very finely chopped.

To make the almond sponge, put the butter, sugar, flour, ground almonds, baking powder, eggs, vanilla and almond extract in a large bowl. Beat with an electric whisk until the mix comes together smoothly. Scrape into the tin, spreading to the corners, and bake for 25-30 mins – when you poke in a skewer, it should come out clean. Cool in the tin for 10 mins, then transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling while you make the second sponge.\\r\\nFor the pink sponge, line the tin as above. Mix all the ingredients together as above, but don’t add the almond extract. Fold in some pink food colouring. Then scrape it all into the tin and bake as before. Cool.\\r\\nTo assemble, heat the jam in a small pan until runny, then sieve. Barely trim two opposite edges from the almond sponge, then well trim a third edge. Roughly measure the height of the sponge, then cutting from the well-trimmed edge, use a ruler to help you cut 4 slices each the same width as the sponge height. Discard or nibble leftover sponge. Repeat with pink cake.\\r\\nTake 2 x almond slices and 2 x pink slices and trim so they are all the same length. Roll out one marzipan block on a surface lightly dusted with icing sugar to just over 20cm wide, then keep rolling lengthways until the marzipan is roughly 0.5cm thick. Brush with apricot jam, then lay a pink and an almond slice side by side at one end of the marzipan, brushing jam in between to stick sponges, and leaving 4cm clear marzipan at the end. Brush more jam on top of the sponges, then sandwich remaining 2 slices on top, alternating colours to give a checkerboard effect. Trim the marzipan to the length of the cakes.\\r\\nCarefully lift up the marzipan and smooth over the cake with your hands, but leave a small marzipan fold along the bottom edge before you stick it to the first side. Trim opposite side to match size of fold, then crimp edges using fingers and thumb (or, more simply, press with prongs of fork). If you like, mark the 10 slices using the prongs of a fork.\\r\\nAssemble second Battenberg and keep in an airtight box or well wrapped in cling film for up to 3 days.
