Other fish in the same family include trout, char, grayling and whitefish. Salmon are native to tributaries of the North Atlantic (genus Salmo) and Pacific Ocean (genus Oncorhynchus). Many species of salmon have been introduced into non-native environments such as the Great Lakes of North America and Patagonia in South America. Salmon are intensively farmed in many parts of the world.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTypically, salmon are anadromous: they hatch in fresh water, migrate to the ocean, then return to fresh water to reproduce. However, populations of several species are restricted to fresh water through their lives. Folklore has it that the fish return to the exact spot where they hatched to spawn.

Many non-Spaniards view paella as Spain\\'s national dish, but most Spaniards consider it to be a regional Valencian dish. Valencians, in turn, regard paella as one of their identifying symbols.\\\\r\\\\n\\\\r\\\\nTypes of paella include Valencian paella, vegetable paella (Spanish: paella de verduras), seafood paella (Spanish: paella de mariscos), and mixed paella (Spanish: paella mixta), among many others. Valencian paella is believed to be the original recipe and consists of white rice, green beans (bajoqueta and tavella), meat (chicken, duck and rabbit), white beans (garrof\\xf3n), snails, and seasoning such as saffron and rosemary. Another very common but seasonal ingredient is artichokes. Seafood paella replaces meat with seafood and omits beans and green vegetables. Mixed paella is a free-style combination of meat from land animals, seafood, vegetables, and sometimes beans. Most paella chefs use bomba rice due to it being less likely to overcook, but Valencians tend to use a slightly stickier (and thus more susceptible to overcooking) variety known as Senia. All types of paellas use olive oil.\",\"img\":\"https://ftp.goit.study/img/so-yummy/ingredients/640c2dd963a319ea671e383f.png\"},{\"_id\":\"640c2dd963a319ea671e37d2\",\"name\":\"Dried Apricots\",\"desc\":\"Apricots that have been dried to preserve them, with a chewy texture and sweet, tangy flavor, commonly used in baked goods, trail mixes, and savory dishes.\",\"img\":\"https://ftp.goit.study/img/so-yummy/ingredients/640c2dd963a319ea671e37d2.png\"},{\"_id\":\"640c2dd963a319ea671e37c6\",\"name\":\"Goose Fat\",\"desc\":\"Fat obtained from the rendered meat of a goose, commonly used for frying or roasting potatoes, vegetables, and meats to add flavor and texture.\",\"img\":\"https://ftp.goit.study/img/so-yummy/ingredients/640c2dd963a319ea671e37c6.png\"},{\"_id\":\"640c2dd963a319ea671e3712\",\"name\":\"Lemon Juice\",\"desc\":\"Lemon juice is the acidic liquid obtained from squeezing or pressing fresh lemons.

Small delicate leaves are better than the large bristly ones but, if only large leaves are to hand, then trim them to roughly 12 by 12 cms so that you don\\'t get too many layers of leaves around the filling. And remove any stalks. Drain the preserved leaves, immerse them in boiling water for 10 minutes and then leave to dry on a tea towel before use. \\\\r\\\\nBasmati rice with butter and pine nuts is an ideal accompaniment. Couscous is great, too. Serves four.\\\\r\\\\nFirst make the filling. Put all the ingredients, apart from the tomatoes, in a bowl. Cut the tomatoes in half, coarsely grate into the bowl and discard the skins. Add half a teaspoon of salt and some black pepper, and stir. Leave on the side, or in the fridge, for up to a day. Before using, gently squeeze with your hands and drain away any juices that come out.\\\\r\\\\nTo make the sauce, heat the oil in a medium pan. Add the ginger and garlic, cook for a minute or two, taking care not to burn them, then add the tomato, lemon juice and sugar. Season, and simmer for 20 minutes.\\\\r\\\\nWhile the sauce is bubbling away, prepare the vine leaves. Use any torn or broken leaves to line the base of a wide, heavy saucepan. Trim any leaves from the fennel, cut it vertically into 0.5cm-thick slices and spread over the base of the pan to cover completely.\\\\r\\\\nLay a prepared vine leaf (see intro) on a work surface, veiny side up. Put two teaspoons of filling at the base of the leaf in a 2cm-long by 1cm-wide strip. Fold the sides of the leaf over the filling, then roll it tightly from bottom to top, in a cigar shape. Place in the pan, seam down, and repeat with the remaining leaves, placing them tightly next to each other in lines or circles (in two layers if necessary).\\\\r\\\\nPour the sauce over the leaves (and, if needed, add water just to cover). Place a plate on top, to weigh the leaves down, then cover with a lid. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and cook on a bare simmer for 70 minutes. Most of the liquid should evaporate. Remove from the heat, and leave to cool a little - they are best served warm. When serving, bring to the table in the pan - it looks great. Serve a few vine leaves and fennel slices with warm rice.

Most Scotch bonnets have a heat rating of 100,000–350,000 Scoville units. For comparison, most jalapeño peppers have a heat rating of 2,500 to 8,000 on the Scoville scale. However, completely sweet varieties of Scotch bonnet are grown on some of the Caribbean islands, called cachucha peppers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese peppers are used to flavour many different dishes and cuisines worldwide and are often used in hot sauces and condiments. The Scotch bonnet has a sweeter flavour and stouter shape, distinct from its habanero relative with which it is often confused, and gives jerk dishes (pork/chicken) and other Caribbean dishes their unique flavour. Scotch bonnets are mostly used in West African, Antiguan, Kittitian/Nevisian, Anguilan, Dominican, St. Lucian, St Vincentian, Grenadian, Trinidadian, Jamaican, Barbadian, Guyanese, Surinamese, Haitian and Cayman cuisines and pepper sauces, though they often show up in other Caribbean recipes.

Today, the fungus is a popular ingredient in many Chinese dishes, such as hot and sour soup, and also used in Chinese medicine. It is also used in Ghana, as a blood tonic. Modern research into possible medical applications has variously concluded that A. auricula-judae has antitumour, hypoglycemic, anticoagulant and cholesterol-lowering properties.\",\r\n      \"img\": \"https://ftp.goit.study/img/so-yummy/ingredients/640c2dd963a319ea671e3854.png\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"_id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e37a6\",\r\n      \"name\": \"Fideo\",\r\n      \"desc\": \"A type of thin, spaghetti-like pasta commonly used in Mexican cuisine, often toasted before being added to soups or stews.\",\r\n      \"img\": \"https://ftp.goit.study/img/so-yummy/ingredients/640c2dd963a319ea671e37a6.png\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"_id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e3711\",\r\n      \"name\": \"Lemon\",\r\n      \"desc\": \"A citrus fruit that has a sour, acidic flavor and is often used in cooking and baking to add tartness and brightness to dishes.

(1–1.8 kg) and is skinned and cut into short lengths for sale.\\r\\n\\r\\nOxtail is a bony, gelatin-rich meat, which is usually slow-cooked as a stew[1] or braised. It is a traditional stock base for a soup. Traditional preparations involve slow cooking, so some modern recipes take a shortcut using a pressure cooker. Oxtail is the main ingredient of the Italian dish coda alla vaccinara (a classic of Roman cuisine). It is a popular flavour for powder, instant and premade canned soups in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Oxtails are also one of the popular bases for Russian aspic appetizer dishes (холодец or студень), along with pig trotters or ears or cow \\\"knees\\\", but are the preferred ingredients among Russian Jews because they can be Kosher.\\r\\n\\r\\nVersions of oxtail soup are popular traditional dishes in South America, West Africa, China, Spain [2] and Indonesia. In Chinese cuisine, it's usually made into a soup called 牛尾汤 (niúwěi tāng, \\\"oxtail soup\\\"). In Korean cuisine, a soup made with oxtail is called kkori gomtang (see gomguk). It is a thick soup seasoned with salt and eaten with a bowl of rice. It can be used as a stock for making tteokguk (rice cake soup). Stewed oxtail with butter bean or as main dish (with rice) is popular in Jamaica, Trinidad, and other West Indian cultures. Oxtail is also very popular in South Africa where it is often cooked in a traditional skillet called a potjie, which is a three-legged cast iron pot placed over an open fire. Oxtail is also eaten in other southern parts of Africa like Zimbabwe and served with sadza and greens. In the United States, oxtail is a mainstay in African American and West Indian households. In Cuban cuisine, a stew can be made from oxtail called rabo encendido. In the Philippines, it is prepared in a peanut based stew called Kare-kare. In Iran, Oxtail is slow-cooked and served as a substitute for shank in a main dish called Baghla-Poli-Mahicheh which is prepared with rice, shank (or oxtail) and a mixture of herbs including dill, coriander, parsley and garlic.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the United States, oxtail has the meat-cutting classification NAMP 1791.\",\r\n      \"img\": \"https://ftp.goit.study/img/so-yummy/ingredients/640c2dd963a319ea671e3841.png\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"_id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e37f7\",\r\n      \"name\": \"Mirin\",\r\n      \"desc\": \"A type of sweet rice wine that is commonly used in Japanese cuisine for its mild sweetness and ability to balance flavors in dishes like teriyaki sauce.\",\r\n      \"img\": \"https://ftp.goit.study/img/so-yummy/ingredients/640c2dd963a319ea671e37f7.png\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"_id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e3800\",\r\n      \"name\": \"Lard\",\r\n      \"desc\": \"Rendered pork fat that is often used in cooking and baking for added flavor and texture.\",\r\n      \"img\": \"https://ftp.goit.study/img/so-yummy/ingredients/640c2dd963a319ea671e3800.png\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"_id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e368b\",\r\n      \"name\": \"Celery Salt\",\r\n      \"desc\": \"A seasoning made from ground celery seeds and salt, often used as a flavoring for snacks, seasonings, and condiments, such as Bloody Mary cocktails, pickles, and potato chips.\",\r\n      \"img\": \"https://ftp.goit.study/img/so-yummy/ingredients/640c2dd963a319ea671e368b.png\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"_id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e36d4\",\r\n      \"name\": \"Fish Sauce\",\r\n      \"desc\": \"A pungent, salty sauce made from fermented fish commonly used in Southeast Asian cuisine as a seasoning and condiment.\",\r\n      \"img\": \"https://ftp.goit.study/img/so-yummy/ingredients/640c2dd963a319ea671e36d4.png\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"_id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e36dc\",\r\n      \"name\": \"French Lentils\",\r\n      \"desc\": \"Small, greenish-brown lentils that have a slightly nutty flavor and a firm texture.

Salmon are intensively farmed in many parts of the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nTypically, salmon are anadromous: they hatch in fresh water, migrate to the ocean, then return to fresh water to reproduce. However, populations of several species are restricted to fresh water through their lives. Folklore has it that the fish return to the exact spot where they hatched to spawn. Tracking studies have shown this to be mostly true. A portion of a returning salmon run may stray and spawn in different freshwater systems; the percent of straying depends on the species of salmon.

Another very common but seasonal ingredient is artichokes. Seafood paella replaces meat with seafood and omits beans and green vegetables. Mixed paella is a free-style combination of meat from land animals, seafood, vegetables, and sometimes beans. Most paella chefs use bomba rice due to it being less likely to overcook, but Valencians tend to use a slightly stickier (and thus more susceptible to overcooking) variety known as Senia.

Also known as scallions or green onions, spring onions are in fact very young onions, harvested before the bulb has had a chance to swell.\",\r\n      \"img\": \"https://ftp.goit.study/img/so-yummy/ingredients/640c2dd963a319ea671e384a.png\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"_id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e3666\",\r\n      \"name\": \"Balsamic Vinegar\",\r\n      \"desc\": \"Balsamic vinegar (Italian: aceto balsamico), occasionally shortened to balsamic, is a very dark, concentrated, and intensely flavoured vinegar originating in Italy, made wholly or partially from grape must.

Some spices may be particular to the region, such as ash berries, chufa, grains of paradise, orris root, monk's pepper, cubebs, dried rosebud, fennel seed or aniseed, galangal, long pepper.

Small delicate leaves are better than the large bristly ones but, if only large leaves are to hand, then trim them to roughly 12 by 12 cms so that you don't get too many layers of leaves around the filling. And remove any stalks. Drain the preserved leaves, immerse them in boiling water for 10 minutes and then leave to dry on a tea towel before use. \\r\\nBasmati rice with butter and pine nuts is an ideal accompaniment. Couscous is great, too. Serves four.\\r\\nFirst make the filling. Put all the ingredients, apart from the tomatoes, in a bowl. Cut the tomatoes in half, coarsely grate into the bowl and discard the skins. Add half a teaspoon of salt and some black pepper, and stir. Leave on the side, or in the fridge, for up to a day. Before using, gently squeeze with your hands and drain away any juices that come out.\\r\\nTo make the sauce, heat the oil in a medium pan. Add the ginger and garlic, cook for a minute or two, taking care not to burn them, then add the tomato, lemon juice and sugar. Season, and simmer for 20 minutes.\\r\\nWhile the sauce is bubbling away, prepare the vine leaves. Use any torn or broken leaves to line the base of a wide, heavy saucepan. Trim any leaves from the fennel, cut it vertically into 0.5cm-thick slices and spread over the base of the pan to cover completely.\\r\\nLay a prepared vine leaf (see intro) on a work surface, veiny side up. Put two teaspoons of filling at the base of the leaf in a 2cm-long by 1cm-wide strip. Fold the sides of the leaf over the filling, then roll it tightly from bottom to top, in a cigar shape. Place in the pan, seam down, and repeat with the remaining leaves, placing them tightly next to each other in lines or circles (in two layers if necessary).\\r\\nPour the sauce over the leaves (and, if needed, add water just to cover). Place a plate on top, to weigh the leaves down, then cover with a lid. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and cook on a bare simmer for 70 minutes. Most of the liquid should evaporate. Remove from the heat, and leave to cool a little - they are best served warm. When serving, bring to the table in the pan - it looks great. Serve a few vine leaves and fennel slices with warm rice. Spoon the braising juices on top and garnish with coriander.\",\r\n      \"description\": \"A Moroccan-inspired dish made with lamb, tomatoes, onions, and spices (such as cinnamon, ginger, and cumin), typically served with couscous or bread.\",\r\n      \"thumb\": \"https://ftp.goit.study/img/so-yummy/preview/Lamb%20tomato%20and%20sweet%20spices.jpg\",\r\n      \"preview\": \"https://ftp.goit.study/img/so-yummy/preview/Lamb%20tomato%20and%20sweet%20spices.jpg\",\r\n      \"time\": \"90\",\r\n      \"youtube\": \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaZb1MnFBgA\",\r\n      \"tags\": [\r\n        \"\"\r\n      ],\r\n      \"ingredients\": [\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e372c\",\r\n          \"measure\": \"2 tbsp\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e36e8\",\r\n          \"measure\": \"4cm piece finely chopped\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e36e3\",\r\n          \"measure\": \"2 cloves peeled and chopped\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e377f\",\r\n          \"measure\": \"800g peeled and chopped \"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e3712\",\r\n          \"measure\": \"2 tbsp\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e3687\",\r\n          \"measure\": \"1 tsp\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e378d\",\r\n          \"measure\": \"50\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e36d0\",\r\n          \"measure\": \"1 large\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e370d\",\r\n          \"measure\": \"400g\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e37ae\",\r\n          \"measure\": \"1 medium\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e3669\",\r\n          \"measure\": \"2 tbsp\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e36a0\",\r\n          \"measure\": \"2 tbsp\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e36af\",\r\n          \"measure\": \"2 tbsp chopped\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n          \"id\": \"640c2dd963a319ea671e36a5\",\r\n          \"measure\": \"½ tsp ground \"\r\n        }\r\n      ],\r\n      \"rating\": 3.84\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      \"_id\": \"6462a8f74c3d0ddd28897fdf\",\r\n      \"title\": \"Lamb Rogan josh\",\r\n      \"category\": \"Lamb\",\r\n      \"area\": \"Indian\",\r\n      \"instructions\": \"\\r\\nPut the onions in a food processor and whizz until very finely chopped.
